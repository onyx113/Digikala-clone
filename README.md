# React + Vite

im starting to learn react and vite so i decided to make a simple website for a company that sells products online like digikala.com

this is the first website i made so it may be not perfect but i will try my best to make it better.

*its not like a real digikala website and lot of tags are different.

*i used html, tailwind css, react and vite.
